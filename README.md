# Heart Disease Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the heart disease dataset using clustering algorithms.

## Overview

The analysis aims to explore patterns in the heart disease dataset using K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. It includes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling features, and evaluating clustering performance metrics.

## Tasks

1. **Load the Dataset**: Fetch the heart disease dataset and load it into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features using StandardScaler, and encode categorical variables if applicable.
3. **Apply Clustering Algorithms**: Implement K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to identify patient clusters.
4. **Visualize Clusters**: Use PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization of clustering results.
5. **Evaluate Clustering Performance**: Calculate silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index to assess clustering quality.
6. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**: Explore GMMs to identify risk factors associated with heart disease.
7. **Compare Algorithms and Choose Best**: Compare the performance of different clustering algorithms and select the most effective one.
